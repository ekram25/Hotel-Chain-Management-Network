# Hotel-Chain-Management-Network
## Project Desceiption
The project revolves around a network of a hotel chain operating in three cities with each city
having five departments- reception, reservations, accounts, food and beverages and guest
rooms. Among these five departments, the guest rooms have a wireless access point(WAP) to
allow wireless internet access to the guests. And the entire network uses the OSPF routing
protocol.
